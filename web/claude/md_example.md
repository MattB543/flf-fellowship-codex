**DecisionMate (AI-powered group facilitation)**
- Launched landing page + small ad test; 9 early-access signups via Nuño’s tweet (~600 impressions): https://decisionmate.xyz/
- Prototype live and tested with multiple groups (2–7 ppl): https://decisionmate.fly.dev/
- Early feedback and positioning
  - Meeting preparation use case may be stronger than “make meetings faster”
  - Voice input likely important; initial UI needs polish; add favicon
  - Parallel-convo facilitation UX explored (Convergent Facilitation overview UI concept)
  - Considered renaming (e.g., “Liaison”); dogfooding interest from FLF
- Acquisition experiments
  - Google Ads smoke test ($20) despite high est. CPA; targeting “reach consensus in meetings”–style queries
  - Waitlist outreach started (emailed first 9 signups for discovery calls)

**Pivotal (multi-agent scheduling/coordination)**
- Slack-native topic/workflow engine; repo: https://github.com/cooperativetech/pivotal
- Scheduling MVP close to done; targeting ~80–90% utility and FLF test
- Architecture: listens via Slack Events API; workflows are pluggable “decide next messages + state updates”
- Shared backend potential with DecisionMate and other coordination tools discussed; two tracks hacking in parallel for now
